#You can say that HTML classes and Python classes have the same use cases, with some subtle differences.
#
# HTML/CSS lets you format classes like this:
#
# [CSS]
# .class {
#   background-color: blue;
# }
#
# whereas, Python takes few longer lines of code, and is encouraged to assign a variable to your newly created Class:
#
# class Class():
#   background-color = "Blue"
#
# object = Class()
#
# [CONSOLE]
# print(object.background-color)
# Blue
#
